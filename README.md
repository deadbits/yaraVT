# Yara VirusTotal Commenter
You know you scan files with Yara anyways, why not give your findings back to the community?
This script can scan a folder of samples against a provided Yara ruleset and optionally submit the matching Yara rule names to each files respective VirusTotal report as a comment.

I'd highly recommend only using this if you are scanning with high confidence Yara rules, unless you want to spam VT and have your account reputation tarnished!

## Important
**This repo is pre-alpha and hasn't even yet been tested in any sane way. I wouldn't recommend using it yet until it can be tested and it all runs smoothly.**
